Chess Game - Project for Ynov Sophia Antipolis 
Realised in TypeScript & React.
Welcome to our Chess Game project, a chess web application developed in TypeScript and React. This game allows you to play chess to enjoy a game with a friend in a two-player local mode.

Deployed in : https://chess-eight-beta.vercel.app/

Features
Full chess game: All standard chess rules are respected, including special moves like castling, en passant capture and pawn promotion.
Modern user interface: Thanks to React, the game offers a smooth and responsive user interface.
Artificial Intelligence ( not available ): The game includes an AI opponent based on the Minimax algorithm with an advanced rating function. You can adjust the difficulty level by changing the depth of the AI search tree.
TypeScript: The project is written entirely in TypeScript, which ensures safer and more maintainable code.
